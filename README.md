# Sheesh

Hi there, seems like you stumbled upon this Github repository! This is a starter for [Aiden Bai](https://aidenybai.com).

## Rationale

The build process with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) intentionally minimalist, allowing for extreme predictability and robustness.

It also uses [Lucia](https://lucia.js.org/) for logic and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. These technologies allow a very consistent design process during development. For the best experience, deploy to [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

## Usage

Use this project as a template on GitHub or fork. Clone into a local repository and run `yarn`.

- `yarn dev` - Start development server and build assets for development.
- `yarn build` - Build assets for production.
- `yarn serve` - Serve assets for production.
- `yarn lint` - Lint codebase and produce warnings.
- `yarn lint:fix` - Lint codebase and fix warnings.
- `yarn cleanup` - Run Prettier on codebase.
