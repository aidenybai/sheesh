### Vite + Lucia + Tailwind starter that'll make you go SHEESH

Project starters are weirdâ€”Generally they're slow and bulky, or so mimimalist that it's unscalable. Sheesh aims to fix this - by using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) we get fast development iteration, intentionally minimalist process, aka extreme predictability and robustness. It also sports modern libraries like [Lucia](https://lucia.js.org) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). This allows for a very consistent design process during development.
